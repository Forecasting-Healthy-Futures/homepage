These platforms are typically built using open source technologies and can be customized to meet specific data visualization and analysis requirements. Open source dashboards can provide powerful data insights and help users make better informed decisions. One of the benefits of open source dashboards is their flexibility. Because they are built using open source technologies, they can be customized and extended to meet specific needs. Users can choose from a range of visualization tools, including charts, graphs, maps, and tables, to display data in a way that best suits their needs. They can also choose from a range of data connectors to integrate with different data sources, such as databases, APIs, and spreadsheets. Another benefit of open source dashboards is their cost effectiveness. Since they are built using open source technologies, they are often available for free or at a much lower cost than proprietary dashboard solutions. This makes them a popular choice for small businesses, non-profit organizations, and individual users who have limited budgets for data visualization and analysis. Open source dashboards are also highly customizable. Users can choose from a range of themes and templates to create a dashboard that reflects their brand or organization. They can also add custom code to extend the functionality of the dashboard and create unique data visualizations."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"However, there are also some challenges associated with open source dashboards. They require some level of technical expertise to set up and customize, which can be a barrier for non-technical users. Also, because they are built using open source technologies, support may not be as readily available as with proprietary dashboard solutions. Overall, open source dashboards provide a flexible, cost-effective, and customizable way to visualize and analyze data. They can be a powerful tool for businesses and organizations of all sizes to gain insights from their data and make better informed decisions."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Currently, a single dashboard has all the information at every level.
